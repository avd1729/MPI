DNA sequencing and assembly are critical processes in genomics research, enabling the decoding of genetic information and the investigation of various biological phenomena. With the emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies, massive amounts of DNA sequencing data can be generated, necessitating efficient and scalable algorithms for sequence assembly. De Bruijn graph-based approaches have proven to be powerful tools in this context, offering effective solutions for DNA sequence assembly.

This project focuses on exploring and implementing a De Bruijn graph-based approach for DNA sequencing and assembly, with a specific emphasis on an Eulerian approach. The De Bruijn graph is a graph structure that represents DNA sequences, where each node represents a k-mer, a short overlapping sequence of length k, and edges represent connections between k-mers. This graph-based representation facilitates the identification of overlaps and aids in reconstructing the original DNA sequence.

The Eulerian approach utilizes the concept of an Eulerian path, which is a path that traverses each edge of a graph exactly once. By constructing an Eulerian path within the De Bruijn graph, we can efficiently assemble DNA sequences. This method has demonstrated effectiveness in handling large-scale sequencing data, addressing challenges such as sequencing errors, repeats, and complex genomic regions.

Throughout the project, we focus on implementing and optimizing algorithms for various stages of the De Bruijn graph-based approach, including graph construction, Eulerian path determination, and sequence assembly. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using simulated datasets with known reference sequences and compare the results with existing assembly methods. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of the assembly process, taking into account graph pruning techniques, error correction algorithms, and parallelization approaches.

By leveraging the De Bruijn graph-based Eulerian approach, this project aims to make significant contributions to DNA sequencing and assembly techniques. The outcomes of this research have potential implications in diverse domains, including genome analysis, metagenomics, and personalized medicine. They enable a more comprehensive understanding of genetic variations and their functional implications, ultimately advancing our knowledge of biological systems at the molecular level.
