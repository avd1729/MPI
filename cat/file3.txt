Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly in the field of machine translation. This project presents a novel approach to English to Spanish language translation using an Encoder-Decoder network, a prominent architecture in the realm of sequence-to-sequence tasks.

The proposed system comprises two essential components: an Encoder and a Decoder. The Encoder processes the source English sentence and generates a fixed-length representation, capturing the semantic information of the input. This representation is then passed to the Decoder, which generates the equivalent Spanish sentence one word at a time. Both the Encoder and Decoder are implemented using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or their more advanced variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells.

Key objectives of this project include optimizing the network architecture, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and training the model on a substantial parallel corpus of English and Spanish sentences. Transfer learning techniques, such as pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec or fastText, will also be employed to enhance the model's performance. Additionally, attention mechanisms may be incorporated to improve translation quality, allowing the network to focus on relevant parts of the input sentence during decoding.

The results obtained from this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the field of NLP and machine translation, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of Encoder-Decoder networks for English to Spanish translation tasks. Furthermore, the project aims to make the developed model available as an open-source tool, promoting accessibility and fostering further research and development in the domain of neural machine translation.
